# My Reads
Project made to finish a first module in React Nanodregree program on Udacity.

## Project dependencies
To do this project, was used some libraries, like:

1. axios
2. babel
3. eslint
4. fontawesome
5. history
6. husky
7. i18next
8. i18next-browser-languagedetector
9. jest
10. normalize
11. prop-types
12. react
13. react-bulma-components
14. react-i18next
15. react-router
16. react-router-dom
17. react-test-renderer
18. styled-components
19. webpack

Those are main libraries of the project.

## Setup
To init and configure the project it's very simple, there's a lot of scripts done for a better automatization tasks like those.

### Intall
The first necessary step is to install all project dependencies, you can just run on root source:

```
yarn
```

or

```
npm i
```

Wait all while all dependencies are downloaded and configured.

### Start
After that first step has been done, you can start a development local server with:

```
yarn start
```

or

```
npm start
```

A development server will be started at your localhost laptop or computer.

### Tests
To run all project tests, just run:

```
yarn test
```

or

```
npm test
```

All matches files will be tested.

### ESLint
If you need check some code format, the project has been configured with ESLint, so you can check through:

```
yarn lint
```

or

```
npm lint
```

If some error was found, just run the same command with `lint:fix` to try fixed it.

Thanks
